# Nerd's Main Website

Just a main page, nothing too fancy.

### Update ! ( 25/04/2022 )

For now, this site is still under construction, since my HTML, CSS and PHP knowledge constantly evolves. Plus, I'm trying to find a new style that can look cool without having to create complicated, buggy and bloated JS scripts.

If, for some reasons, you have to go to my old website, you can still access it from the following link : https://lonelynerd.github.io/old.html.
