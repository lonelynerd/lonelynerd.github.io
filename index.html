            Hi there ! Thanks for stopping by ! <br />

            I'm a 18 y.o info student who has too much time to spare in little projects instead of practicing courses. Here's different links to my GitHub project pages. Most of them doesn't work properly, but it can serve as a base... I guess. Ah and, by the way, absolutely everything is under the Unliscence or the WTFPL liscence. In onther words, you can do anything, I don't care.<br/>
            
            See ya !
